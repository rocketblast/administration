#Getting Started
In this guide you will be shown how to use the In Game Admin menu. For Counter-Strike we have niether a Web Based Administration
panel nor in game commands however we have an In Game Menu, this makes server administration easy. Although the menu is
relatively simple we have created some guides which should make it easier for you to get started.

###Want to get admin powers?
If you are already a BF admin however want to be an admin on our Counter-Strike servers speak to @Kameeleon on Slack, have your Steam ID ready for us, you can find it [here.](http://steamidfinder.com/) If you are not an admin with any other server hosted by RocketBlast yet, we reccomend you apply [here.](http://bit.ly/adminrb)
